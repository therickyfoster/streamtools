here’s a clean, on-stream rundown you can read or flash on-screen. short, punchy, mission-framed.

# NOW: What we’re building live

* **HeroLens (sensemaking → quests):** the “glue” that turns streams, notes, and field data into **actionable quests, proofs, and public logs**. Feeds education, governance, and regen.
* **OpenStore (decentralized marketplace kernel):** a **Next-Gen Feature Pack** spec + starter repo that’s modular, low-resource friendly, and AI-ready. We’ll ship Vite setup + DX scaffolding, guardrails, and perf hooks.
* **DonorIntent Router (trustware for funds):** a governance smart-contract + spec that **locks funds to contributor intent** and writes **immutable proof chains**. Targets public-good pilots first.
* **\_\_Siberian Apple Orchard Kit (field ops):** printable **Planting Field Kit** (GPS logging, cadence, myco inoculation checklist) for Fort McMurray—our live, verifiable regen node.

# WHY: The spine that ties it together

* **Education that self-replicates:** HeroLens + OpenGamifyEdu → **mythic, gamified learning** that teaches itself forward.
* **Trust at the money edge:** DonorIntent Router → **verifiable alignment** between funding and outcomes.
* **Regeneration on the ground:** Apple project → **proof of care** you can walk through.
* **Zero-Harm Override everywhere:** safety, privacy, and delayed-release protocols baked in.

# LIVE DELIVERABLES (today’s stream)

1. **OpenStore**

   * `vite.config.js` + project boilerplate
   * Safety toggles, perf budget, telemetry stubs (privacy-first)
2. **HeroLens**

   * Core data schema: Sources → Claims → Quests → Proofs
   * Minimal API routes + “Galactic Map” view stub
3. **DonorIntent Router**

   * Spec + interface sketch (deposit, route, prove, dispute)
   * Test plan + threat model checklist
4. **\_\_Apple Field Kit**

   * One-pager PDF draft: gear list, GPS grid, planting cadence, log template

# NEAR HORIZON (next 7–10 days)

* **HeroLens Alpha**: capture → questing loop with exportable proof bundles.
* **OpenStore Alpha**: demo listings, escrow stub, abuse-resistant flows.
* **Router Testnet**: dry-run with simulated donors + public read-only dashboard.
* **Field Trial**: first planting pass + photo/GPS proofs logged through HeroLens.

# GUARDRAILS & ETHOS

* **Zero-Harm & Privacy-Preserving Telemetry**
* **Delayed Impact-Release Protocol** (hold features if public risk > benefit)
* **Low-resource defaults** (offline-first, graceful degradation)
* **No hype, just proofs** (ship small, verify, iterate)

# WHAT VIEWERS CAN DO (right now)

* **Star & watch**: repos as they drop (HeroLens, OpenStore, DonorIntent Router).
* **Test low-spec builds**: report performance + accessibility issues.
* **Contribute modules**: quests, overlays, translations, field data templates.
* **Plant with us**: try the Apple Field Kit locally; send back logs/photos.

# ON-SCREEN ONE-LINER (lower third)

**“Building trustware for a regenerative civilization: HeroLens (quests), OpenStore (market kernel), DonorIntent Router (aligned funding), and a live Apple Orchard field kit.”**

If you want, I can turn this into a quick slide and a printable one-pager next.
